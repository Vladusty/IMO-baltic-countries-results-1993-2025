# IMO-baltic-countries-results-1993-2025
📊 Comparative dataset of International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) results (1993–2025) for Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden, including absolute ranks, number of participating countries, and relative ranks. Includes R code for analysis and visualisations of performance trends.


# Overview
This dataset collects the following annual IMO statistics:
1) Absolute Rank: The position of the country among all participating countries each year.
2) Number of Participating Countries — Total number of countries competing that year.
3) Relative Rank: The country's rank normalised by the total number of participants (Absolute Rank divided by Number of Participating Countries).
4) Inverted Relative Rank: Complementary metric showing how close the country is to the top (1 - Relative Rank).
