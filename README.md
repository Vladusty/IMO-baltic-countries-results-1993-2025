IMO results (1993–2025) for Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden, including absolute ranks, number of participating countries, relative ranks, and inverted relative ranks. Includes R code for analysis and visualizations of performance trends.

# Overview
This dataset compiles the results of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) from 1993 to 2025 for five countries in the Baltic and Nordic regions: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden. It provides detailed annual performance data including:

1) Absolute Rank: The position of the country among all participating countries each year.
2) Number of Participating Countries: Total countries competing in the IMO in a given year.
3) Relative Rank: The country's rank normalized by the total number of participants (rank divided by total participants).
4) Inverted Relative Rank: Complementary metric showing how close the country is to the top (1 - Relative Rank).

These metrics allow for comparative analysis of each country's performance over time, accounting for fluctuations in the number of participating countries.

Included Materials
1) Dataset XLSX: The complete dataset in tabular form for Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden (1993–2025).
2) R Code: Scripts for metrics, and visualization. These scripts generate charts illustrating trends in rankings and relative performance across years.
3) Visualizations PDF and SVG: Pre-generated graphs and plots showing performance dynamics, making it easier to interpret trends and comparisons.
